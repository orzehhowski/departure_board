# departure_board

I wan't to create home live departure board for trams on my nearest station, on my ESP8266. Unfortunately I've got only 0,96" 128*64 Px LCD right now, so it may be little bit small, but it doesn't matter

# purpose

I just hope I'll find it useful, and I wan't to move on with micropython

# data source

I'll be fetching and using data shared by ZTM Poznan:
